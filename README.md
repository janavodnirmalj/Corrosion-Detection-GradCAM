# Corrosion-Detection-GradCAM
This project detects corrosion in images using a pre-trained CNN model (Nash et al., 2022) and visualizes results. The system provides an image marking the corroded area, Grad-CAM explanations, corrosion percentage estimation, and classification based on the corroded percentage.

The developed web application from this approach is available at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shashikatd/Corrosion_Detector

## How the Application Works

This application processes images of steel members to detect and segment areas of corrosion. It assigns a corrosion severity rating on a scale of **Class 1 to Class 10** based on the detected corrosion percentage. furthermore, it provides **Grad-CAM visualizations** to explain the model‚Äôs predictions.

### Workflow:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **User uploads images** of steel members  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model processes each image**, segmenting corrosion areas  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Grad-CAM visualization is generated** to explain the model‚Äôs focus  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Corrosion severity (%) is calculated** and mapped to a **corrosion class (1-10)**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Outputs are displayed per image**, including:
   - **Corrosion overlay image** (visual segmentation of corroded regions)  
   - **Grad-CAM explanation** (heatmap visualization for model interpretability)  
   - **Corrosion class** (severity rating from 1 to 10)  
   - **Corroded percentage** (quantification of corrosion)  

### Features:
- **Batch processing** of multiple images  
- **Real-time updates** with a status indicator  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** through Grad-CAM  
- **Dynamic output visualization** for each image  

### üîπ **Figure 1: Processing Status**
- The detection of corroded segments for the **first image** is completed
- Results are visualised while other images are still being processed
- The **status bar** provides guidance on the analysis progress

### üîπ **Figure 2: Final Output for Multiple Image Submission**
- This figure showcases the **final output** when all images have been processed
- Each image receives an **individual corrosion analysis**
- The interface displays:
  - Corrosion overlay image
  - Grad-CAM explanation
  - Corrosion class (Severity from 1 to 10)
  - Corroded percentage

## Sample Output
A sample output for a given input image is summarised in the following table:
